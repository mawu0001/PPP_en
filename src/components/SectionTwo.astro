      <h2>about</h2>
      <p>
        On a daily basis, I study Multimedia Design at Copenhagen School of
        Design and Technology. Here in my third semester, I have chosen to
        specialize in<span>frontend</span> design.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Outside of school, I work for Gastrotools, where I handle customer
        support. When Iâ€™m not at school or work, you can find me hanging out
        with friends, training at my local gym, or watching a movie at the
        cinema.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would very much like to study backend development, possibly computer
        science, and become a full-stack developer in the future.
